    1.2 What is a class? What is an instance?

Practical Coding Exercise:
Please write a simple JavaScript class for a Car. The class should include the following:

Properties: make, model, and year.
A constructor method that accepts these three properties.
A method called getCarDetails that returns a string formatted as "<make> <model>, <year>".
