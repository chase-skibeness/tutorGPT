Great! Let's move on to the next subject: Computer Networks.

1. Theoretical Questions:
    1.1 What is the difference between TCP and UDP protocols?
        TCP is a handshake based protocol, udp is not it's more of a data stream / broadcast
    1.2 Can you explain what is HTTP and HTTPS, and the differences between them?
        http on port 80 is a hypertext transfer protocol which handles the sending and receiving of data containing hyperlinks which is an incredibly 80s sounding name. HTTPS adds a layer of security and encryption on top of that
    1.3 What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
        IPv4 uses decimal based numbering of IPs whereas IPv6 uses hexadecimal. IPv6 was created due to an incresing shortage of IPv4 global addresses
   
2. Practical Question:
Write a simple HTTP server using Node.js that serves a "Hello, World!" message for any request it receives. Use the http module provided by Node.js.
I don't think I can do this without following a guide which I feel like is no within the spirit of what I'm trying to do here
